Project 3 runs faster than project 2 for a few reasons.
The first is that linked lists do not need to be resized at all, while arrays do if the size constantly changes.
In project 2, the size of the array changes quite often at the higher sized files.
Secondly, deleting an item in Project 2 also means shifting every following element down one.
This takes extra time. But linked lists can just delete the node and reconnect the list.
